# palindrome
Part I:

Write a program palind.c that reads a message, then checks whether it's palindrome (the

letters in the message are the same from left to right as from right to left):

Enter a message: He lived as a devil, eh?

Palindrome

Enter a message: Madam, I am Adam.

Not a palindrome

Ignore all characters that aren't letters. Use integer variables to keep track of positions in the
array.

Hint: Read the message one character at a time (using getchar) and store the characters in

an array. Stop Reading when the array is full or the character read is ‘\n’.

Part II:

Revise the program in Part I to use a pointer instead of an integer to keep track of positions

in the array. Name the new C program as palindP.c .

Question:

1) Put the source code of palind.c and palindP.c in your answer sheet.

2) In your answer sheet, please also attach screenshots of the outputs (note: you can

type any messages you like).
